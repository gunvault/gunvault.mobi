### 1. Information Collection

To maintain and improve the quality and stability of our app, we collect a limited amount of anonymous, non-personal data.

-   **No Personal Information:** We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.
-   **No Firearm Information:** We absolutely do not collect, view, or store any information you enter into the app, such as firearm models, serial numbers, purchase dates, or photos. All data you log in Gun Vault is stored locally and only on your device.

-   **No Device Identifiers:** We do not collect unique device identifiers such as the Advertising Identifier (IDFA).

#### **Information We DO Collect (Anonymous Data)**

To improve the functionality and user experience of our app, we use Google's Firebase services (Analytics and Crashlytics) to collect the following anonymous information:

-   **Usage Data:** This includes which screens are viewed and which buttons are tapped. This helps us understand which features are most popular and where we can make improvements. This data is aggregated and cannot be tied to an individual user.
-   **Crash Reports:** If the app crashes, we collect anonymous diagnostic information to help us identify and fix bugs. This includes information like the device model, operating system version, and the state of the app at the time of the crash. This report **never** contains any of your personal data or firearm information.

### 2. Data Sharing

The anonymous data collected via Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics is processed by Google and is used solely by us for internal purposes to analyze and improve the app.

We do not share this data with any other third parties. You can review Google's Privacy Policy here: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

We have configured these services to operate in a way that respects your privacy and avoids the collection of personal data.
